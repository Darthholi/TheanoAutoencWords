Experimental project showing autoencoders of character frequency of words in a text.

For the report, see https://github.com/Darthholi/TheanoAutoencWords/blob/master/WordsLearning-formt.pdf
For presentation, see https://github.com/Darthholi/TheanoAutoencWords/blob/master/WordyPres.pdf

The code features the machine learning theano library and some c++ libraries to work over characters of words to speed things up.
Nowadays the technology to use would be keras/tensorflow, but the results about the deep representations stay the same.
